## A Family Company

Linda Carter Brokerage is a family owned and operated company that has always specialized in land. We have been in business since Linda was pregnant with Melanie 40 years ago. Melanie has been her assistant and they have been working together as a mother-daughter team for the past 19 years. We are a team of self-starters and take pride in the business that we have created.

We believe that business is personal, and that is why we still handwrite all of our letters. We seal our envelopes and drop them in the mail ourselves. We guarantee a personal touch.
