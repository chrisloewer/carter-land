# Carter-land Website

This is a site I designed for a local ranch broker.  Initially it was deployed using Express powered by NodeJS.

In order to better meet their needs, I am converting this to Grav.

### Deployment Instructions

The contents of this repo need to be in the `user` folder of the grav installation

## GRAV-CONTENT BRANCH

This branch is set up with the git-sync plugin to directly with the live website.  This is intended to work as a backup in case they accidentally mess something up from the Admin Panel.  Changes are **NOT** intended to be made directly to this branch.

This branch will either be merged into Master if something goes wrong, or it will reset to Master if needed.
