# Carter-land Website

This is a site I designed for a local ranch broker.  Initially it was deployed using Express powered by NodeJS.

In order to better meet their needs, I am converting this to Grav.

### Deployment Instructions

The contents of this repo need to be in the `user` folder of the grav installation
